                        <h3>The Web is Ugly & Broken</h3>
                        <p>The browsable web in 2023 is ugly & broken . I believe most people know this even if they don't think about it. It's truly a horrible experience when you have to use a browser and search engine to access information.  Riddled with pay-walls, popups, accept cookie banners, ads and bloated sites. This becomes even worse when trying to access it from a phone.</p>

                        <p>None of these concepts are truly abhorrent by themselves - but having to fight them all at once for the majority of the web is a shit show.</p>
                        
                        <p>Mobile Apps and huge social media sites solve some of these issues by hiding these annoyances behind user account sign ups, integrated ads and sleek mobile application frameworks - but they come at a price.  This isn't a complete list of issues but some of the disadvantages include:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Platform Lock-In</li>
                            <li>Centralized Control</li>
                            <li>Less Portable Data</li>
                            <li>Dead Data</li>
                            <li>User Data Collection Abuse</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>It also changes the way the users search, create and interact with information but that's a topic worth exploring more deeply another time. I'm sure there has been a lot written about this which I'd like to find and review some point soon.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ChatGPT & Generative AI</h3>
                        <p>ChatGPT was maybe the biggest shift in this dynamic since Web 2.0 started taking off. I think this is why it got the huge surge it did so quickly. The user interface was just a text chat box. It had none of issues I mentioned above and the information (text) appeared straight away in front of you. OpenAI carried this to their app when they released that too.</p>
                        
                        <p>I think the user interface experience has been largely overlooked so far as to what helped ChatGPT blow up and what helped it be adopted so quickly. It's easy to understand how this was overlooked as most of the conversation was (rightfully) around the transformative nature of AI.</p>
                        
                        <p>Perhaps this is why Bing Chat & Google Bard have not taken off in the same way yet. They feel like they're trying to bring the modern web into the chatbox along with all of the issues I mentioned before associated with it.</p>
                        
                        <p>I've started paying for ChatGPT Plus so I can get information that should be readily available on the open web. Simple stuff like cooking recipes, basic how-tos and other information lookup type information that didn't and shouldn't require generative AI responses.</p>
                        
                        <p>To me it's worth the money and it's further highlighted just how broken the searchable web is when this experience is just so much more enjoyable.</p>
                        
                        <p>I think this observation is fairly self evident - as conversation around the potential death of tractional search engines started happening very quickly after the public release of ChatGPT</p>
                    
                        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                        <p>It's impossible to know how this will play out, but perhaps the searchable web will become obsolete as AI takes over more and more tasks. If this happens let's hope it doesn't carry over the same horrible user experience trends that the modern web did - or create their own unique bloat and anti-user experiences.</p> 
                        
                        <p>If AI assistants where to take over search engines and websites it raises a few questions. What will user generated content look like? How will content & information be monetized? Are we going to further consolidate into a few large social networks and platforms? </p>
                        
                        <p>I'm hoping there still exists a place for user generated content outside of these platforms. Maybe they'll look more like self hosted API endpoints that any AI can pull information from. The experience of building searchable content online will be less about making it look pretty in a browser. Less website building and more data constructing and writing.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Experiment</h3>
                        <p>This blog/website is an experiment in creating that kind of content on the web in the purest form I can think of.</p>
                        
                        <p>It will be accessible via browsers and readable for humans, but will not contain the bloat associated with most modern websites.</p>
                        
                        <p>My hope is that it also encourages me to work on my writing without worrying about tools or services too much.</p> 
                        
                        <p>This is Web 1.0 slightly updated. Let's call it Web 1.1</p>
                        
                        <p>You can read my specific self-imposed rules for it <a href="../pages/DesignPrinciples.html"> here </a> - and specific technical specifications <a href="../pages/DevEnvironment.html"> here.</a></p>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>The Promise</h3>

                    <p>Smart Homes have been promised to us for a long time. I've always been entranced by the optimistic view of technology in homes of the future - popularized by shows like The Jetsons and Walt Disney's original vision of EPCOT.</p>

                    <p>Yet with the rise of smart home tech in the last decade why hasn't it felt like we're getting close to that promise? In the last 10 years we've made tiny baby steps forward - the pace of innovation and adoption for what is relatively simple tech is a little embarrassing.</p>

                    <p>Pushing aside topics such as smart home standards, wireless protocols and other technical discussion I believe it comes down something more simple.</p>

                    <p>The first modern smart home products were lights, and they're still the biggest category in the market. They're relatively cheap and can make a house feel magical and futuristic. Better yet most people can install them themselves.</p>

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>

                    <p>But there is a major flaw that is stopping them from being in every single home, and that's the traditional light switch.</p>

                    <p>When you install a smart light it's attached to a traditional light switch.</p>

                    <p>When it's in the on position, you get all the benefits of having the magic of a smart light</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dimmable Lights</li>
                        <li>Color / Temperature</li>
                        <li>Automation</li>
                        <li>Scene Control</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>But as soon as you need to turn that light off you're faced with a dilemma. Do you turn off the power and loose your ability to use the  smart features? Or do you figure out how to <i>soft</i> turn it off so the power remains active but the light is no longer shining.</p>

                    <p>This problem is too hard for most people, and unless determined to figure out how to make this work you're left with a more frustrating experience then just having a traditional light bulb.</p>

                    <p>There are workarounds to this including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using traditional lights with a smart switches</li>
                        <li>Placing a battery powered smart switch near a traditional switch and teaching people how to operate it</li>
                        <li>Using a smart relay device behind the traditional switch</li>
                        <li>Relying entirely on phones / sensors / automation's to control the light</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Each of these have their have their advantages and disadvantages but they're all <b>compromises</b> on the smart home promise and require people to engineer their own solution. Which most people will not.</p>

                    <p>The real solution is having both a smart light and smart switch. No compromise in function, always available and nobody has to learn anything new.</p>

                    <p>Yet for some reason smart home companies are not bundling or advertising these products together. Mains powered smart switches do exist but they're not sold as a solution to this problem. Most people don't even realize the problem exists until they've had to experience it themselves.</p>

                    <h3>The Solution</h3>

                    <p>If we want to get serious about smart homes being <b>ubiquitous</b> then we need to get this very simple problem aligned. Here are 3 possible scenarios in which this might be solved:</p>

                    <h4>Scenario 1</h4>
                    <p>Companies that sell smart lights start having smart switches bundled together. This would become the default buying option for smart lights. Consumers would be forced into this and learn it as a requirement.</p>

                    <h4>Scenario 2</h4>
                    <p>As costs lower and the technology gets better 3rd Party install services rise and more people opt to get whole houses fitted with smart lights - this would include the installation of smart switches.</p>

                    <h4>Scenario 3</h4>
                    <p>The rise of natural language AI and smart sensors remove the need to manually control lights. Almost all lights would just remain turned on at the wall - and the cultural norms around controlling home lighting would shift to automation and voice commands for fine control in the limited situations the predicted AI doesn't get it right.</p>

                    <p>The most satisfying solution to me feels like Scenario 1 but with the rate of innovation in AI right in this moment in time feels like Scenario 3 will come first.</p>

            <description>A quick look into Why reliability in the smart home is so important and discussing why Thread & Matter are not a magical solution to it</description>

                    <hr>
                    <p><b>Published: 2023.12.08</b></p>
                    <p><b>Blog Entry: 3</b></p>
                    <hr>

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

                    <p>This is my second take on the smart home. You can read the first one about what's holding back the smart home here <a href="../posts/2.html"> The Lightswitch is Holding Back the Smart Home</a> I'll use lights / light switches as my main talking point again as they're the simplest category.</p>

                    <h3>The Reliability Problem</h3> 

                    <p>In a traditional house when you use a light it's instant and works every time. Unless you're dealing with a completely dead bulb you typically don't have to think about it.</p>

                    <p>If a smart home makes this process less relabel I'd argue the value of smart lighting does not justify the unreliability you've introduced. I think most people would probably accept around a 1/1000 rate of error (let's say one technical problem every couple of years).</p>

                    <p>There is a lot of layers of technical stuff going on in a modern technology. This introduces ever increasing points of failure. While having these points of failure on phones and computers are not without their own issues, they seem to be manageable for the personal computer category.</p>

                    <p>Having these common technical issues translate over to household appliances can quickly become a much more frustrating experience to the end user. Imagine how much worse these common Phone/PC issues are when view from a smart home lens:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>My lights are slow, it takes 2 seconds to turn on</li>
                        <li>I'll be eating dinner and my lights will just randomly flash</li>
                        <li>My lights don't turn on when I press the buttons anymore</li>
                    </ul> 

                    <p>As a smart home enthusiast I have a higher tolerance for this and I can fault find on a technical level. I'd guess though that for most people this happening more then a few times over a certain period would be enough to want to remove the smart lights - at least from any critical location. This highlights the importance of having an almost perfectly reliable smart home environment.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately a lot of people with smart homes (myself included) rarely have 99.9% reliability. Even the most well thought out homes will hit issues now and then due to various reasons.</p>

                    <h3>Does Thread Hold Up Yet</h3>
                    
                    <p>I've seen a lot of people on the internet, and spoken to a lot in person who are aware of this issue. A lot try and solve it by convincing themselves that choosing a product with their perceived best wireless technology will fix things.</p>

                    <p>The current trend (which admittedly starting to break down) is that Thread was going to be our saviour and solve all our problems. While Thread does aim to solve a lot of the issues it isn't perfect. As it's a fairly new protocol I'm hoping it matures and get's better as time goes on.</p>

                    <p>In my experience so far these have been the most reliable products in my home in order of most to least reliable.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>LIFX Smart Switch (WiFi - Mains)</li>
                        <li>LIFX Downlights (WiFi-  Mains)</li>
                        <li>Phillips Hue Lights (Zigbee - Mains)</li>
                        <li>NanoLeaf Essentials Bulb (Thread - Mains)</li>
                        <li>Phillips Hue Buttons (Zigbee - Battery)</li>
                        <li>Ikea Shortcut Buttons (ZigBee - Battery)</li>
                        <li>Eve Motion Blinds (Thread - Battery) </li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>That's 2 WiFi devices I rate the most reliable. And while I'd consider my Hue Lights extremely close in comparison to my LIFX ones it questions the myth that Thread is just a better protocol to use. <b>WiFi has been around since the 90s, it used in billions of devices and has time to mature as a reliable wireless protocol.</b></p>

                    <p>I'm disappointed to have to put my Eve Motion Blinds on the bottom of the list as they're actually a very high quality product. For those devices in particular I think it's actually to do with Apple when a Non-Thread enabled device becomes the Home Hub.</p>

                    <p>It's also worth noting that in my experience things that are battery operated are a lot less reliable - this is understandable.</p>

                    <h3> It Comes Down to Implementation </h3>
                    
                    <p>You don't choose what smartphone you're going to buy on technical hardware specs alone. A lot of the decision comes down to software and implementation. Smart Home products should be no different.</p>

                    <p>Let's say you have a competing smart light from 2 different companies. They both support Matter and both have a Thread Radio in then. These can still vary drastically in quality. <b>The firmware and hardware are separate from the protocols they choose to support.</b></p>

                    <p>Not all smart home products are created equal. You need to make sure you're picking a product from a vendor with a proven track record for quality and ongoing improvement as the smart home field matures.</p>

                    <p>Maybe one day every product you buy will work 99.9% of the time but right now careful research, planning and patience is needed.</p>
