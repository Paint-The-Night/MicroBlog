<p>This post will be a quick reaction to one of the announcements from D23 2024. As a lover of themed entertainment and in particular Disney Parks I want to document my initial reaction to everything announced this year. I'll split these up onto sections. These reactions come from my own perspective as an Australian who only gets to visit the parks once every few years. As of this writing I have been to every Disney Park across the world except the ones at Walt Disney World.</p>
