            <h2>Web Hosting</h2>
            <p>This website is hosted in an Amazon S3 Bucket. S3 buckets do not allow for HTTPs connections. SO I've had to use the AWS CloudFront Platform as a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</p>
    
            <hr>
    
            <h2>Version Control</h2>
            <p>git is the undisputed standard for version control so it's been used in this blog. While it's not that important for collaborative work it let myself or anyone interested peel back the curtain to see any historical changes right from the begging of the project. </p>
    
            <hr>
    
            <h2>Text Editing</h2>
            <p>At the time of creations Visual Studio Code is the text editor I'm using to create this blog. Mostly for spell check and ease-of-use</p>
    
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Language</h2>
            <p>HTML is only real language you can for writing a website so it's been used. I would have preferred to write in markdown and I know there are tools for allowing that to happen - but thought it wasn't nessicary due to the <a href=DesignPrinciples.html> design principles </a> of this blog. </p>
