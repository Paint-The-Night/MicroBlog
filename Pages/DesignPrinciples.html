            <h1> Design Princnples</h1>
            <p>Below are my self imposed design principles for this micro blog</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>No Ads</h2>
            <p>The Micro Blog will never include ads. Ads have their place on the internet but the cost of Micro Blogs are low enough they can be funded by other means</p>
            
            <hr>

            <h2>No Frameworks</h2>
            <p>No Web Building Frameworks will be used for the website. It will all be pure HTML/CSS. This is to keep things simple and avoid bloat.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>No Server Side Code</h2>
            <p>Server Side Code can create a lot of nice elements to website but it comes at a cost. The main reason the Micro Blog should not use it is to avoid the need to run a PHP Server in able to view it properly. No Server Side code adds to the portability of the micro blog.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Open Source</h2>
            <p>Source Code for the Micro Blog website will be published in full for transparency and data sharing. It's hosted on GitHub for simplicity in development but will also be available as a compressed file to download from the website itself</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>No Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies will not be used for this website. This is to reduce to need for scripting and increase privacy.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Tiny</h2>
            <p>Keeping the file size as tiny as possible to maximize portability</p> 
            <p>Last Recorded Size: 176Kb</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Portable</h2>
            <p>As much as possible keep information on this blog self-contained.Links can be used when appropriate but never rely on them to be accessible.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>No AI Generated Content</h2>
            <p>None of the content on the Micro Blog will be generated by AI unless clearly specified. This is to be as transparent as possible and help future training sets.</p>
